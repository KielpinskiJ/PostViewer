# PostViewer: Application for Cogitech

As part of the recruitment process for [Cogitech](https://cogitech.pl/), I've developed this application as a test task. The project focuses on displaying, sorting, filtering, and searching posts using Vue.js and Pinia.

## Features and Project Highlights:

- **Displaying Posts:** The application fetches all posts from an external API and displays them on the page.
- **Post Details:** Users can select a post to view its details.
- **Deleting Posts:** Users have the option to delete a post.
- **Sorting and Filtering Posts:** Users can sort posts alphabetically, reverse alphabetically, from longest to shortest, and vice versa. They can also filter posts by user or search posts.
- **Pagination:** Users can browse posts by pages.

## Technologies and Tools Used:

- Vue.js
- CSS (with SCSS)
- JavaScript
- Axios
- Pinia
- JSONPlaceholder API (for fetching data)

**Demo link:** You can view a live demo of the project [here](https://kielpinskij.github.io/PostViewer/).

**Note:** This project was created for a recruitment test and is not intended to represent a live production website.
